# **Sahayya - Networking application for Community Welfare for all**
Sahayya is a networking platform for certified NGOs and donor companies to facilitate smooth functioning of community welfare activities, in form of mobile application.
Sahayya is a Flutter app which allows users to be of type Donor or NGO (both companies and NGOs can be verified through a separate pipeline). The donors can create a request for commodity they wish to donate while NGOs can create request for goods they require alongside a deadline. Each of the users can then apply to each others application - chat on a real-time forum and whence approved, can complete the transaction.

A permanent invoice is generated upon success which can be stored and downloaded as a record. There's also added functionality based on client request to have documents uploaded alongside applications and requests, an option to fetch the nearby NGOs (distance algorithms) and more.

Sahayya is a complete package to solve the problem statement!
